# Tee Time Tours

Tee Time Tours is a site that offers the assistance in hassle free booking of golfing trips and tours.  Visitors to the web site can view some popular golfing destinations via our gallery page.  They can suggest a location and all other requirements via our enquiry page.  Our team will take this information and come back with some suggestions and options based on wants and needs.  When the customer decides on what they would like, the representitive will then organise and book the trip and send back all details.

## Features 

This website has many cool features, including seemless navigation, eye catching photo gallery, clear descriptions of what is on offer and an overall fun effortless experience.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes seperate links to Home page, Gallery, Enquiries and About us Pages.  The user can also navigate to the home page from anywhere on the site by clicking on the main logo and company name.  The menu will indicate what page the user is currently residing by underlining the menu option.  Each page will have the exact menu layout for familiarity. 
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  - Each menu item will highlight by enlarging slightly by becoming underlined and bold when scrolled over.

### Features Left to Implement

- If time allowed and I was to enhance this Website, I would like to make the destinations section on the home page more interactive.  Currently they are dead images of locations..ideally, I would like the user to be able to click on a destination and then be brought to a page with different golf courses available in that location, and perhaps seperate gallery for each course.
- Another addition would be the review section on About us page.  Currently they are snippets of quaotes made by happy customers.  It would be great to make these short videos of actual people telling their story about the experience that they had.

## Testing 

Testing my website was a natural part of the development work on a day to day basis.  Each little change was then tried and tested.  So hundreds of tests were carried out as a natural progression.  These are not all documented.  However, when my site was at a point where its was fully functional and a place where I believed was consumable, I conducted further documented, comprehensive testing.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. 

### Content 

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
